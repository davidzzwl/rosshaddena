# Sublime XPath Plugin v2.0.0

## New features:
- Query XML and (X)HTML documents using XPath 1.0 expressions (accessible via the command palette)
  - with syntax highlighting and intelligent auto-completion!
  - evaluates and shows results as you type, and moves the cursor to the highlighted result
  - with a custom `print` function that can be used as a debugging aid by logging nodesets etc. to the sublime console
  - optionally normalize whitespace when displaying text results (via a setting)
  - with history, and a command to re-run the previous query and select all the results in the document
  - with support for variables
  - use the node under the first selection/cursor as the context node, and all the nodes under the cursors available in the `$contexts` variable
- Select entire contents of tag(s) at cursor(s), with or without the open/close tags, with other navigation commands available
- Show XML well-formedness parse errors, with a new entry in the command pallette to move the cursor to the location where the error occurred
- Clean HTML/"tag soup" into valid XML
- option to only show the current xpath in the status bar if the view is not dirty

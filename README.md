Sublime Text 3 - XPath Plugin
============

- Copy XPath at cursor(s) to clipboard.
- Updates status bar text to XPath of current line.

Planned features:

- display xpath on load without requiring selection movement first

Potential improvements:
- optionally show attributes in the path, allow user preference to specify which attributes (i.e. id)
- efficiency improvements for multiple selections
- efficiency improvements for small cursor movements (i.e. within same element)
- efficiency improvements for repeated duplicate cursor relocation (i.e. optimise for reads by caching document structure)

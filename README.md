Sublime Text 3 - XPath Plugin
============

- Copy XPath at cursor(s) to clipboard.
- Updates status bar text to XPath of current line.

Note:  This currently requires properly indented XML.

Planned features:

- display xpath at new selection position, not old
- work on html too
- display xpath on load without requiring selection movement first
- check syntax rather than requiring file to be saved with specific extension
- option for which attributes to show in the path (i.e. id)
- don't require sgml to be indented
- show element indexes in the path
- efficiency improvements for multiple selections

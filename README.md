Sublime Text - XPath Plugin
============

- Copy XPath at cursor(s) to clipboard.
- Updates status bar text to XPath of current line.

Created using ST3, but for all I know it works in ST2 as well.

I made this for a friend, and to be honest this plugin is not really useful to me at all.
That being said, I will likely make attempts at any filed issues.

Note:  This currently requires properly indented XML.
Note2:  XML is stupid.

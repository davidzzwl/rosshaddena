Sublime Text 3 - XPath Plugin
============

- Copy XPath at cursor(s) to clipboard.
- Updates status bar text to XPath of current line.

Note:  This currently requires properly indented XML.

Planned features:

- display xpath on load without requiring selection movement first
- option for which attributes to show in the path (i.e. id)
- show element indexes in the path
- efficiency improvements for multiple selections
